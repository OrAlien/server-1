Creating a new server is simple. All you need to do is

- include 'server.hpp' header file

    #include "./server.hpp"

- create your own task class

- instantiate 'Server' class with your task class,
  create a 'Server' object passing port number as a costructor argument,
  and call 'run' method on it

    Server< MyTask >( "12345" ).run()


Class MyTask has to provide such interface

    class MyTask
    {
    public:
        MyTask( IConnection * connection );

        static IConnection::Action start();

        IConnection::Action parse(
            char const * const buffer,
            std::size_t const bytesTransferred
        );  

        void parseError();

        void process();

    private:
        IConnection * m_connection;
    };

Constructor 'MyTask::MyTask' accepts 'IConnection' pointer as a argument.
You can use 'IConnection' to communicate yourself with the world. It
provides such functions like 'read', 'response', 'broadcast' and much more.

'MyTask::start' says what the first action will be after a new connection is
created. You may use any of following
- 'IConnection::Action::Read', use it if you want to start with reading.
  Good for most cases. As a result 'MyTask::parse' function will be called
  at the beginning.

- 'IConnection::Action::Process', use it if you do not want to read anything
  but write something immediately. A good example here may be day_time server.
  As a result you skip 'MyTask::parse' but 'MyTask::process' function will
  be called.

- 'IConnection::Action::ReadError', you still can use is as a valid action
  but makes no sense as an initial action. However if used 'MyTask::parseError'
  function will be called after a new connection is established.

'MyTask::parse' function is called every time server has read some data. This
is a good place for reading and parsing your request.
- If during a processing you find that you expect more data return
  'IConnection::Action::Read'. The function 'MyTask::parse' will be called
   again with a new chunk of data.

- If you find your request incorrect please return 'IConnection::Action::ReadError'.
  Server will call 'MyTask::parseError' function for you.

- If you read all incoming data correctly and you want to start them process
  return 'IConnection::Action::process'. As a result 'MyTask::process' function
  will be called.

So now we know how to read data from a connection. What about other stuff. What
about writing response back? In order to do this you have to use 'IConnection'
interface. It has many useful functions.

    class IConnection
    {
    public:
        virtual void disconnect() = 0;

        virtual void setId( std::string const & id ) = 0;

        virtual std::string const & getId() const = 0;

        virtual void read() = 0;

        virtual void parseError() = 0;

        virtual void process() = 0;

        virtual void response(
            char const * const message,
            std::size_t const size
        ) = 0;

        virtual void unicast(
            std::string const & receiverId,
            char const * const message,
            std::size_t const size
        ) = 0;

        virtual void broadcast(
            char const * const message,
            std::size_t const size
        ) = 0;

        virtual void log(
            char const * const message,
            std::size_t const size 
        ) = 0;

        virtual void doNothing(
            sys::error_code const & errorCode
        ) = 0;
    };

'IConnection::disconnect' closes a connection. Any further reading or writing is not
possible anymore.

'IConnection::setId' lets you set ID for a connection. You may need ID to send a message
to one particular connection. Use together with 'IConnection::unicast'.

'IConnction::getId' returns ID for a connection.

'IConnction::read' call it every time you want to read more data from the connection.
As a result 'MyTask::parse' function will be called with a new chunk of data.

'IConnction::parseError' triggers 'MyTask::parseError' function call.

'IConnction::process' triggers 'MyTask::process' function call.

'IConnction::response' sends data to a receiver.

'IConnction::unicast' sends data to one particular connection. First that connection
has to have ID set. Use together with 'IConnction::setId' function.

'IConnction::broadcast' sends data to every other connection.

'IConnction::log' prints message in server's log on standard output.

'IConnection::doNothing' is an auxiliary function. It is designed to be used as a
callback continuation for a async operation. It means that after async operation
has been completed nothing more is expected to happen.
