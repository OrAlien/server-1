In the simpliest case to create running server you need to create your Task class and
install it in the Server. In order to do it you have to override 'IServer::createTask'
function. That is all! Please find example/echo as an example.


                ------{uses}------           ------{uses}------
               v                  \         v                  \
         IServer <>--{contains}-- IConnection <>--{contains}--ITask
            ^                          ^                        ^
            |                          |                        |
         Server                   Connection                    |
            ^                                                   |
            |                                                   |
         MyServer                                             MyTask
         createTask()


However you may need to use some server's additional features, like broadcast, unicast,
logging or server's state. Then you have to implement not only Server and Task but 
also a Connection. Please find example/chat as an example.


                ------{uses}------           ------{uses}------
               v                  \         v                  \
         IServer <>--{contains}-- IConnection <>--{contains}--ITask
            ^                          ^                        ^
            |                          |                        |
         Server                   Connection                    |
          ^  ^                     ^      ^                     |
         /    \                   /        \                    |
 ServerExt1  ServerExt2  ConnectionExt1  ConnectionExt2         |
 doIt()      doThat()    doIt()          doThat()               |
        ^     ^                   ^        ^                    |
         \   /                     \      /                     |
       MyServer                   MyConnection                MyTask


See ./server.hpp to see how to create your server.
For connection please look at ./connection.hpp.
How to define task you can learn from ./task.hpp.
./main.cpp is about how to run everything together.
